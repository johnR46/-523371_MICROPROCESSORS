ESP8266 wirelessly controlled robot car 

1. NodeMCU Amica board + 

2. ESP8266 SMT Module - ESP-12E, however you don't want to work directly with the SMT, but instead with the:
NodeMCU = open-source firmware, may also refer to their very popular devkit board design which is available from $8 to $10

## Misc. Documentation
Arduino Support

NodeMCU ESP-12E Pin mapping
In Arduino, add support for NodeMCU board. (a lot of annoying GUI stuff)
Then can program directly in Arduino over USB cable :)

"This example demonstrates how to turn the ESP8266 into an access point (AP), and serve up web pages to any connected client."

## Troubleshooting

* Does LED_blink work?

Both LEDs should blink, but alternating. Serial monitor should display low (<10) values.

* Does motor_helloworld work?

Both motors should move, specifically they should accelerate, switch directions, and repeat. Serial monitor should display commanded speed.
